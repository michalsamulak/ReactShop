# React Shop
REACTSHOP is basic e-commerce website.  
This shopping website can by easy tailored for any database to render required products. In this version I fetch data from https://fakestoreapi.com/ 
I implemented many reusable react component to build this shop and make this application perfect for extending to bigger e-commerce.



## Tool & technologies I've used

- React
- TypeScript
- fetching API
- Visual Studio Code
- SASS
- TS

Thanks to hook useContext data retrieved from API or database can be pass very easy thought application. 
Shop contain four main functionalities, home page with fetching all products, categories page where listed all categories, cart with complex shop basket actions and contact page with simple contact form used Formik.  
 


## How to use it

Download zip file and unpack it. 
Use `npm install` command to get all required dependencies.
```
npm install
```
To fetch data from different API required only changing `apiPaths` object in file `utilis.ts`.
